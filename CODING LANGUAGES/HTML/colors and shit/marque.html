    <h1 style="color: green;">Welcome to Larib's Webpage</h1>

    <marquee style="color: red; font-size: 54px; font-weight: bold;">Eshal pagal</marquee>

    <p style="color: blue;">This is an example paragraph describing how the marquee tag
        was used in older versions of HTML to create scrolling text. The text color is blue, and we are
        discussing the use of obsolete tags in modern web development.</p>

    <p style="color: purple;">While the marquee tag was easy to use, it is no longer
        recommended due to compatibility issues and lack of flexibility.
        Developers should now use CSS and JavaScript to achieve similar effects.</p>
