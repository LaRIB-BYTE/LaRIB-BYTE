    <h1>Understanding the p Tag in HTML</h1>

    <p>
        The p tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph. It creates a block of text that is separated from other content
        with some margin or spacing.
        The browser automatically adds space before and after each paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
        Heres another example of a paragraph. The text inside a p tag is automatically wrapped to fit within the web
        page's layout,
        and it does not require any manual line breaks unless specified with the br tag.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can use as many p tags as needed to divide text into readable sections.
