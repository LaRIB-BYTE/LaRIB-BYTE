    <p> Poem by the SHAKESPEARE</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.shakespeare.org/explore/shakespeare/hamlet">
        "To be or not to be, that is the question:
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        And by opposing end them? To die, to sleep—
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to—'tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wished."
